# Stargate VR

This is a learning project to get started with Unity and OpenXR. The goal is to find the star in the dungeon. As reference, I've followed Black Whale Studios tutorials on Youtube. The game features some of my own ideas like:

### A fade-in starting screen

### Auto generated level

### Random decoration

And 
- Simple combat system.
  - The player can pick up an axe and successfully hit enemies.
  - The player can die and recover health if not hit for a while.
